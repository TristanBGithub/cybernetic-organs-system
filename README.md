# cybernetic-organs-system
A futuristic company specializing in creating bio-compatible cybernetic organs for human augmentation and replacement. This project will require a deep understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to simulate the complex interactions between biological and mechanical components.

## Classes
CyberneticOrgan: Represents a cybernetic organ and contains information on its ID, model, functionality, and compatibility. Has methods to return these details and check its compatibility with a patient.

Patient: Represents an individual patient. Information contained includes the patient's name, age, medical history, and an ArrayList containing the cybernetic organs installed in the patient. Has methods to return these details and add a new organ.

OrganInventory: Represents the organs currently contained in the inventory. Includes an ArrayList for the inventory and methods to add a new organ to the inventory and return an organ given its model.

## How to run
Open a terminal and navigate to the com.cybernetic folder containing the classes.
